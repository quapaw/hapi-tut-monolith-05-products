# Breaking the Monolith by using hapi 
## Background
Let me get the disclaimer out of the way: I am not an expert on Hapi
I started looking into Hapi's ability to break components out.
This is my attempt to follow other tutorials from a hello world to a true component system.
I have broken this down into the following steps

#HAPI Tutorial - Monolith - 5 - product

So the 05-products api has been update with same change and customers api
Look at 05-main to run the full system
